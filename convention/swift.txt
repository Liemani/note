# guard
- If the body consists of only the keyword "return" without any value following it, you can write it on a single line.
- To emphasize the control flow branch, the "return" statement must be written on the next line.
- 아주 간명한 경우에 한하여 return 을 한 줄에 담는 것을 허용한다
- guard 는 간단한 condition 에만 사용한다
    - condition 이 이해하기 쉽지 않다면 if 를 사용하라
